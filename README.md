This is a personal project I did on hypnotic linguistics. I was interested in whether I could isolate key important features of hypnotic language from hypnotic documents using a simple classifying technique like naive bayes. This would be useful because there is not very much literature on how to properly conduct a hypnotic induction and there is a lot of myth surrounding hypnosis in general. However, hypnosis is a scientific phenomenon that we simply do not know very much about, and it is potentially very useful, so I was interested in exploring the way it works from a computational perspective. The paper in this repo shows my results (successful!). 

Additionally you will find a naive bayes implementation with a GUI. Feel free to take this code and expand on it. Currently the GUI is written so that the system will only work if you have 2 categories, but I'm sure there's an easy way to generalize the design to multiple classes. Feel free to get in touch with me if you have any comments or questions!
